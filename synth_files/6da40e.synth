R(185632):Is a possibility!


H(215844):Hmmmmm
H(215877):I don't know what to give my friend advice
R(226677):I think that showing empathy is better than any advise. Problems are so complex and unique! But if you show to your friend that you truly understand his/her feelings your friend will be less lonely with the struggle 😉
